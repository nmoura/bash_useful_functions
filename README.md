# Useful functions for BASH

This repository contains:

  - a file with useful functions that I developed for use in my scripts;
  - a directory called `tests_for_useful_functions` containing little example scripts to show in practice how to use these functions.

I developed these functions to:

  - Standardize log - `logger` function;
  - Parsing of configuration file - `parser` and `parser_section_items` functions;
  - Stop script execution if the user who ran a script is not root - `require_root` function;
  - Define some useful variables, like username and basename - `define_username` and `define_basename` functions.

Before each function in the file you can read a brief description.
